### Introduction
As the group project required by CMU 24780 Engineering Computation, Codeemon is developed by five CMU graduate students. It is a 2D adventure inspired by classic Pok√©mon, offering a fresh twist with redesigned characters, unique animals, new adventure map and battle scenes. Built primarily using OpenGL/C++ with some Python integration, it blends creativity and technical expertise to provide an experience that is both nostalgic and refreshingly innovative.
